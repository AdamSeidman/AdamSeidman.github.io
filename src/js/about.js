    content: "I'm currently in my fifth year at the Rochester \
    Institute of Technology. At RIT, I study Computer Engineering, and I am on an accelerated \
    track to get my bachelors and masters by the end of the year. I have also \
    completed an immersion in public policy. I am heavily involved with our school's Baja \
    SAE team, where I design electrical projects for our vehicle. For the third year, \
    I am even serving on the team's executive board. I have always loved everything about \
    both engineering and math. I enjoy learning about these skills, getting to use creativity, \
    and solving problems. When I am not at RIT, some of my favorite pastimes include chess, camping, \
    reading, and puzzles."
