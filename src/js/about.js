    content: "I am a recent graduate from the Rochester Institute of Technology. \
    At RIT, I studied Computer Engineering and also completed an immersion in public \
    policy. I was heavily involved with RIT's Baja SAE team, where I designed many electrical \
    projects for our vehicles. For three years, I served on the team's executive board. \
    I have always loved everything about both engineering and math. I enjoy learning about \
    these skills, getting to use creativity, and solving problems. Some of my favorite pastimes \
    include chess, camping, reading, and puzzles."
