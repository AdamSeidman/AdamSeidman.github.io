    content: "I am an electrical engineer. I currently work with City Theatrical in \
    Carlstadt, NJ where I design, test, and build wireless DMX/RDM electronics. \
    I am also a recent graduate from the Rochester Institute of Technology. At school, \
    I was heavily involved with RIT's Baja SAE team, where I created electrical \
    projects for our vehicles. For three years, I served on the team's executive board. \
    I have always loved everything about both engineering and math. I enjoy learning about \
    these skills, getting to use creativity, and solving problems. Some of my favorite pastimes \
    include chess, camping, reading, and puzzles."
